# LaTeXGenerator v1.0

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

After growing tired of managing my LaTeX dependencies and changes to my LaTeX notes formats over the years, I've decided to make myself a desktop app to manage how my LaTeX projects are managed.

My LaTeXGenerator uses Python (with Tkinter for GUI) to create myself new project folders in a logical/proper way.

Started Jan 31, 2020 by [Nick Chubb](http://nchubb.com)

## How it works

* get user input
* create new project folder
* populate new project folder with newly created .tex documents

## To-Do

1) Complete Folder and file creation functions
2) Complete restructuring of my template .tex documents
3) Generate metadata file for new project (inlcude list of LaTeX functions I have written)
4) Correctly generate titlepage and table of contents **(for reports)**

## The Future...

* functionality to manage my resume and cover letters with header
* compile to pdf...? (or should the users TeX editor handle that?)
