# LaTeXGenerator v1.0

After growing tired of managing my LaTeX dependencies and changes to my LaTeX notes formats over the years, I've decided to make myself a terminal app to manage my LaTeX files.

My LaTeXGenerator uses Python to create myself new project folders in a logical/proper way.

* create new project folder
